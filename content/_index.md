# Eat Smarter Today with Jill

Jill Knopoff is a Registered Dietitian and Nutritionist with over 25
years of experience working with various health conditions. Jill's main
philosophy is to start at the beginning with each client. When a client
is met where they are, changes small and large can be made to arrive at
a determined destination. There isn't any one particular diet or
protocol. Each person is an individual and requires a personalized
nutrition plan.
